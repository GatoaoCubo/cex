## Error Handling

- **Step fails**: retry once with revised prompt; if still fail, signal `marketing_copy_error` to N07
- **Quality gate fails** (score < 8.0): return to copy step, apply F6 retry, max 2 revisions
- **MCP unavailable**: proceed with formula-based approach from KC; note in output
- **No brand voice card**: write in neutral professional tone; flag "[BRAND VOICE CARD RECOMMENDED]" at top

## Signals

| Signal | Emitter | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| marketing_copy_complete | n02-marketing-hub | All deliverables saved, compiled, committed |
| marketing_copy_error | n02-marketing-hub | Unrecoverable failure, escalate to N07 |
